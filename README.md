# Low Power DSP Module Using Approximate Circuits

This project explores the design and implementation of **low-power Digital Signal Processing (DSP) modules** using **approximate computing techniques**. It is aimed at achieving energy-efficient computation for signal processing tasks without significantly compromising output accuracy â€” a trade-off acceptable in many DSP applications like image/audio processing, edge computing, and IoT systems.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To develop and evaluate **low-power MAC (Multiply-Accumulate)** and other DSP modules using **approximate arithmetic units** such as:
- Approximate Adders (e.g., LOA, ETA, Hybrid Adders)
- Approximate Multipliers
- Hybrid Approximate-Exact Designs
